    # Implementation Notes/Hints:
    #
    # 1. Read "How do I automatically escape HTML?" in the SinatraRB FAQS: https://sinatrarb.com/faq.html#escape_html
    #
    # 2. Use the gem 'erubi' (not 'erubis'!) and add it to the project by including it in the Gemfile
    #
    # 3. The place you will add that `set ...` line is in ApplicationController
    #
    # 4. In erb, to include raw text (bypassing any sanitization), use <%== your_output_with_intentional_html_in_it %>
